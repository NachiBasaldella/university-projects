üöÄ New Project Completed: Diamond Data Analysis üíé

I‚Äôve just completed Activity 4 for my Data Analysis course, where I worked with a dataset of 54,000 diamonds to explore and model the factors that determine their market value.

üîç Key Focus Areas:

Exploring the relationship between physical characteristics of diamonds (such as weight, cut, color, and clarity) and their price.
Fitting linear regression models to predict prices based on key features.
Implementing data preprocessing techniques to enhance model accuracy.
This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling using tools like Python and seaborn. I'm excited to continue applying these insights to future projects and to delve deeper into the field of data science.

üß† Interested in discussing more about this analysis or the impact of these factors on the diamond industry? Feel free to connect and leave me a comment or message. I‚Äôm always open to learning and sharing knowledge! #DataScience #Analytics #Python #Seaborn #DataAnalysis #MachineLearning
